There are two types of phones - ios and android.

iphones - by Apple Inc.

iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. 
It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. 
It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android.

The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. 
Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with 
the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have 
specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. 
Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common 
result is the undo command) or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching 
between portrait and landscape mode). Apple has been significantly praised for incorporating thorough accessibility 
functions into iOS, enabling users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use its products.

Android
-------
Google and open source
Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel 
and other open source software, and is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 
In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS for 
wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, 
digital cameras, PCs and other electronics.

Google's Android and Apple's ios comparison
-------------------------------------------
Google's Android and Apple's iOS are operating systems used primarily in mobile technology, 
such as smartphones and tablets. Android, which is Linux-based and partly open source, is
more PC-like than iOS, in that its interface and basic features are generally more customizable 
from top to bottom. However, iOS' uniform design elements are sometimes seen as being more user-friendly.
